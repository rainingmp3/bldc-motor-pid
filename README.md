# bldc-motor-pid
This project focuses on modeling, simulating, and optimizing a DC motor driving a mechanical load. The objective is to design a control system that enables the motor to reach a desired angular velocity with minimal overshoot, steady-state error, and energy.

The project was done in both Matlab and Python.
